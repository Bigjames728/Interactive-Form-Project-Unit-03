# Interactive Form Project Unit 03

Using a keyup event listener on my credit card number input (line 267), I created real time error messaging.
This means that as a user starts to type in numbers, it will show an error message live until the
user reaches 11 digits, or passes the 16 digit mark.


I also added the extra credit conditional error message (line 177) to show one message if the email input is 
empty and to show another message if there is an input but it isn't formatted correctly.
